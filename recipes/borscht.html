    <p>Borscht is a sour soup that is traditionally made with meat stock and boiled vegetables. The Ukrainian version, which features beets, is perhaps the most well known type — but varieties of borscht can be found throughout Central and Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Sausage: This Ukrainian borscht recipe starts with a pound of pork sausage.</li>
        <li>Vegetables: You’ll need beets, carrots, baking potatoes, cabbage, and an onion.</li>
        <li>Canned tomatoes: Use drained diced tomatoes and canned tomato paste.</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil: Cook the onion in oil.</li>
        <li>Water: You’ll need almost nine cups of water for this big-batch soup.</li>
        <li>Garlic: Three cloves of garlic add bold flavor.</li>
        <li>Sugar: A teaspoon of white sugar lends subtle sweetness.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: Season the borscht with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Sour cream: Top the borscht with sour cream.</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs: Garnish the soup with fresh parsley or dill.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Cook the sausage and set aside.</li>
        <li>Boil water, add the sausage, then add the vegetables and diced tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Cook the onion, stir in the tomato paste, and thin with water. Transfer to the pot.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, cover, and turn off the heat. Stir in the sugar and seasonings.</li>
        <li>Ladle into bowls and garnish with sour cream and fresh herbs.</li>
        </ol>
